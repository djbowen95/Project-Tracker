# Project-Tracker
Simple jQuery and Bootstrap project.

# About
This project was built for the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Coding Bootcamp, as a classroom mini-project, from scratch to a given [brief](./docs/BRIEF.md). It was built for week 4 of the course: which focused on jQuery and Bootstrap.

# Features
## 1A. jQuery: DOM Manipulation to Render HTML
The core objective of this project was to learn and practice jQuery, so all HTML elements are rendered through jQuery methods. Examples of jQuery methods I used to manipulate the DOM and render HTML include:  
 - Used the jQuery `$("#")` syntax to fetch the the root element from the HTML, by id.
    <details><summary>See example </summary>Will edit in an example</details>
 - Used the `.append()` method to render elements within that root element
    <details><summary>See example </summary>Will edit in an example</details>
 - Used the `.text()` method to add text content to rendered HTML elements
    <details><summary>See example </summary>Will edit in an example</details>
 - Used the `.attr()` method to assign properties, such as classes, to rendered HTML elements
    <details><summary>See example </summary>Will edit in an example</details>

## 1B. jQuery: Event Handling, for Click Events
All event handling was done through jQuery methods. The examples below are for the first event handling function I built for the project: a click event for a button that controlled conditional rendering on the form element. When clicked, it would hide or display the form. To do this, I:
 - Used the jQuery `.on()` method to create an event handling callback function
    <details><summary>See example </summary>Will edit in an example</details> 
 - Used the `.css()` method to change the css `display` property for the element I wanted to change.
    <details><summary>See example </summary>Used `display: none` and `display: block` (the default).</details>
